When thecomputer boots, parts oftheoperating system anddrivers are
loaded intomemory, which allows theCPUtoprocess instructions faster and
speed uptheboot process .
After theoperating system isloaded, programs opened bytheuser arealso
loaded intomemory .Iftoomany programs areopen, thecomputer swaps the
data inthememory between theRAMandthehard diskdrive .
Acomputer's performance islargely attributed totheamount ofmemory
contained within it.Ifacomputer does nothave therecommended memory to
runtheoperating system anditsprograms, itresults inslower performance .
Themore memory acomputer has,themore information andsoftware itcan
loadandprocess quickly .Random Access Memory (RAM)

RAM istheinternal memory ofthecomputer forstoring data, programs, and
program results .
RAMisvolatile .Data stored initislostwhen weswitch offthecomputer orif
there isapower failure .
There aretwomain types ofRAM
•SRAM (Static RAM)
•DRAM (Dynamic RAM)RAM Types

RAM Types Cont.

SRAM (Static RAM)
SRAM ismade upoffourtosixtransistors .Itkeeps data inthememory aslongas
power issupplied tothesystem unlike DRAM, which hastoberefreshed
periodically .
DRAM (Dynamic RAM)
DRAM allows tostorage ofeach bitofdata inaseparate capacitor within a
specific integrated circuit .DRAM needs toberefreshed with voltage regularly .
Elseitloses theinformation stored onit.RAM Types Cont.
7
SRAM DRAM
The access time of SRAM is low. The access time of DRAM is high.
It uses flip -flops to store each bit of 
information.It uses a capacitor to store each bit of 
information.
It does not require periodic refreshing to 
preserve the information.It requires periodic refreshing to preserve 
the information.
The cost of SRAM is high. The cost of DRAM is less.
It has a complex structure. Its structure is simple.
It requires low power consumption. It requires more power consumption.RAM Types Cont.

Types ofDRAM
Synchronous DRAM (SDRAM)
Synchronises thememory speed with CPU clock speed sothat thememory
controller knows theexact clock cycle when therequested data willbeready .
Thisallows theCPUtoperform more instructions atagiven time.Typical SDRAM
transfers data atspeeds upto133MHz.
Rambus DRAM (RDRAM)
Itwaspopular intheearly 2000sandwasmainly used forvideo game devices and
graphics cards, with transfer speeds upto1GHz.RAM Types Cont.

Types ofDRAM
Double Data Rate SDRAM (DDR SDRAM)
DDRSDRAM isatype ofsynchronous memory that nearly doubles thebandwidth
ofaSingle Data Rate (SDR) SDRAM running atthesame clock frequency by
employing amethod called "double pumping," which allows thetransfer ofdata
onboth therising andfalling edges oftheclock signal without anyincrease in
clock frequency .
DDR1SDRAM hasbeen succeeded byDDR2,DDR3,andmost recently, DDR4
SDRAM .Although operating onthesame principles, themodules arenot
backward -compatible .Each generation delivers higher transfer rates andfaster
performance .Memory Packaging
10
Memory isavailable invarious physical packaging .
Single In-Line Memory Module (SIMM)
These modules were widely used from thelate1980stothe1990sandarenow
obsolete .
Dual In-Line Memory Module (DIMM)
Current memory modules come inDIMMs ."Dual in-line" refers topins onboth
sides ofthemodules .ADIMM originally hada168-pinconnector supporting a64-
bitdata bus,which istwice thedata width ofSIMMs .Thewider busmeans that
more data canpass through aDIMM, translating tofaster overall performance .
Latest DIMMs based onfourth -generation Double Data Rate (DDR4)SDRAM have
288-pinconnectors forincreased data throughput .Role of RAM in Computer Performance

Larger RAMspace translates tomore computing power .
PCcanbenefit from adding more RAM.
With increased RAM, theapps canfunction properly without competing for
workspace .TheOperating System (OS) nolonger needs toperform increased
code anddata swapping between theresource access memory andthehard
drive .Swapping isacommon cause ofpoor processing performance .
Increased RAMenhances theability tomultitask using resource -intensive apps.
RAMhastwomain attributes thataffect thecomputer's performance .
•Memory Capacity
•Memory SpeedRole of RAM in Computer Performance Cont.

Memory Capacity
Thenumber ofGBsamemory module hascanincrease theprograms thatcan
runsimultaneously .
Butbefore upgrading theRAM, auser must ensure thattheoperating system
willsupport thenewamount ofmemory .
Thecapacity ofmemory acomputer canhave depends onthemotherboard
installed inthecomputer andtheoperating system .
Most motherboards willsupport either twoorfourmemory modules, butthe
type andamount ofmemory candiffer widely from onemotherboard to
another .Role of RAM in Computer Performance Cont.

Memory Capacity Cont .
Capacity oftheRAMofacomputer canholddepends ontherunning version of
theoperating system, which depends ontheCPU.
Most ofthe32-bitWindows andLinux /Unix operating systems supports upto
4GBofmemory .
64-bitsystems support upto128GB.
Also, Windows 10Pro,Education, andEnterprise allow asmuch as2TB.Role of RAM in Computer Performance Cont.
14
Memory Speed
Theamount oftime that RAM takes toreceive arequest from theprocessor
andthen read orwrite data.Thefaster theRAM, thefaster theprocessing
speed .
Faster RAM increases thespeed atwhich memory transfers information to
other components which makes thecomputer much more efficient .
RAM speed ismeasured inMegahertz (MHz), millions ofcycles persecond so
thatitcanbecompared totheprocessor's clock speed .
Thespeed oftheprocessor andthebusspeed ofthecomputer motherboard is
thelimiting factors onthespeed ofRAMinstalled inthecomputer .Role of Secondary Storage in Computer Performance
15
Secondary storage orsecondary memory isatype ofcomputer memory thatis
used tostore data andprograms thatcanbeaccessed orretrieved even after
thecomputer isturned off.
Secondary memory isnon-volatile and canstore data and programs for
extended periods oftime.
Secondary memory plays animportant roleinmodern computing systems and
isessential forstoring large amounts ofdata andprograms .
Thesizeofthehard drive installed inacomputer ismeasured inGigabytes
(GB) andTerabytes (TB).Role of Secondary Storage in Computer Performance

Diskorstorage space affects theoverall performance ofacomputer system .It
stores theOperating System andother files that acomputer anditsusers
need.
Themore space onadisk, thefaster theperformance ofthedisk.Specifically,
theread/write speed ofadiskisaffected byhowmuch freespace ithas.
Also, thefree space onacomputer’s diskaffects thespeed ofbooting and
howfastitcanopen applications .Role of Secondary Storage in Computer Performance 
Cont.
17
Aswecontinue tostore files onadrive, theused space grows toward the
maximum capacity .
Hard drive starts splitting files andstoring them wherever itcanonceit’s
running lowonspace .This results inlowperformance since scattered files
must allberead from their locations before using them .
When thediskrunsoutofstorage space, itwon’t beable tostore more files.
Inaddition, thecomputer willboot slower, open programs slower, andan
overall slowdown willsetin.
Inextreme situations, ifthediskpartition where theOSisinstalled becomes
full,theOSmaynotboot.Role of Secondary Storage in Computer Performance

Temporary files affect both used space andfree space onadrive .When
uninstalling anapplication from thecomputer, itleaves behind some junk
files.Also, temporary filesandcookies from webbrowsers gather over time.
These files may behiding indifferent directories foralong time.Some
temporary filesmayneed third-party applications toscan andremove them .
Therefore, aslong asthese files remain undetected, they keep affecting the
available space onastorage drive .Role of Secondary Storage in Computer Performance 
Cont.
19
Normally, 15%to20%freespace should beenough forahard diskdrive .That
should beenough toprevent anysignificant slowdown intheoperation ofthe
computer .
Following actions canhelptorelease more diskspace onthecomputer .
•Uninstall applications thatarenolonger inuse
•Delete orbackup unnecessary files
•Occasionally empty thecomputer’s recycle bin
•Scan andclean temporary files, cached data, andbrowser cookiesQ&A
