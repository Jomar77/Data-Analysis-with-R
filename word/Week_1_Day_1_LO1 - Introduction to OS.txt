Introduction to Operating Systems
AnOperating System (OS)isasoftware thatmanages computer hardware and
software resources andprovides common services forcomputer programs .
OSactsasaninterface between computer hardware components andtheuser
andother software .

Introduction to Operating Systems Cont.
There aretwomain types ofSoftware .
1.System Software
2.Application Software
OScomes under thecategory ofSystem Software .
OSisthemain subtype ofSystem Software .
Every device must have anOStomanage andcontrol itsoperations .
It’sanessential software thatrunsinthebackground ofacomputer system .
What aretheremaining software types under System Software???
Device Drivers, Firmware, Programming Language Translators, Utilities 4
Introduction to Operating Systems Cont.
Kernel
Kernel isthecore component ofanoperating system .
Itmanages operations ofcomputer hardware andperforms
tasks such asmemory and CPU time management, disk
management, taskmanagement, etc.
Kernel acts asabridge between application programs and
hardware -level data processing .
Kernel loads firstintomemory when anoperating system is
loaded andremains inmemory until theoperating system is
shutdown again .5

Shell
Theshell istheouter layer oftheoperating
system that manages the interaction
between theuserandtheOS.
Theshell communicates with theoperating
system byeither taking input from theuser
orashell script .
Ashell script isasequence ofsystem
commands thatarestored inafile.

User Mode VsKernel Mode
These arethetwomodes ofanoperating system .
When anapplication program isrunning thecomputer isinUser Mode .For
example, writing adocument, reading aPDF ,browsing theinternet, etc.This
mode haslimited access tothehardware .So,itisalsocalled lessprivileged
mode, slave mode, orrestricted mode .
When theprocess isinUser Mode andrequires anyhardware resource, that
request issent tothekernel .Then thecomputer enters Kernel Mode from
User Mode which isalsocalled privileged mode orsystem mode .
Thistransition isknown as“context switching ”.

Security Management
User & Privilege Management
Human Computer Interface (HCI)9
Functions of an Operating System Cont. 
Device Management
AnOperating System manages device communication using respective drivers .
Adevice driver isaprogram thatcontrols theoperation ofaspecific type of
device .Itprovides theinterface fortheOSthat allows interaction with the
device .
10
Functions of an Operating System Cont. 
Device Management Cont.
Thefollowing activities areperformed bytheoperating system fordevice
management .
•Allocates andde-allocates devices todifferent processes .
•Keeps records ofthedevices .
•Decides which process canusewhich device forhowmuch time.
11
Functions of an Operating System Cont. 
Processor Management / Scheduling
Theoperating system controls theorder inwhich processes have access tothe
processor anddetermine theprocessing time that each process must stayin
theprocessor .Thisiscalled process scheduling .
Activities performed bytheoperating system inprocessor management .
•Keeping track ofthestatus ofprocesses using aprogram called Traffic
Controller .
•Allocating andde-allocating theprocessor when itisnotrequired .
12
Functions of an Operating System Cont. 
Processor Management / Scheduling  Cont.
Multiprogramming VsMultitasking
Executing more than one program inasingle processor iscalled multi -
programming .Multiprogramming organises thejobs inthemain memory to
increase CPUutilization .
Running ofmore than onetasksimultaneously inthesystem iscalled multi -
tasking .Eg:Typing inadocument while theprinting process isrunning .In
multitasking, theCPU isassigned toaprocess foraspecified duration
called time slice, after thistime period, theCPU isswitched toanother
process .
13
Functions of an Operating System Cont. 
Memory Management
Theoperating system controls themain memory which isalsocalled primary
memory .
Main memory isastorage area thatcanbeaccessed directly bytheCPU.The
program(s) thatneeds tobeexecuted should remain inthemain memory .
OSrunsamemory manager program that...
•Keeps track ofallocated memory portions
•Maps memory toeach process
•Controls howmuch memory toallocate toeach process
•Determines when aportion ofmemory should beavailable foraprocess14
Functions of an Operating System Cont. 
Input / Output Management
Controlling input andoutput devices isamain roleofanoperating system .
TheOSmanages I/Odevices inmany ways…
•Itrecords which device requires processor time sothattheprocessor can
communicate with thedevice without anyconflicts .
•Itprioritises processes based oncontrol signals thattheI/Odevice sends
andreceives .
•IfanI/Odevice makes amore critical request than what iscurrently
being executed, theOScaninterrupt what iscurrently being executed
andswap tothemore important task. 15
Functions of an Operating System Cont. 
Interrupt Handling
Aninterrupt isasignal that issent totheprocessor torequest immediate
attention .When theprocessor receives thisrequest, itsuspends what itis
doing andrunstheprocess associated with theinterrupt .
Theprocessor canbeinterrupted foranumber ofreasons, including :
•Ahardware device hassignaled thatithasdata toprocess
•Ahardware device hascompleted ataskthatitwasasked todo
•Asoftware process needs aservice tobeprovided orasOSfunction tobe
performed
•Anallocated amount oftime hasexpired, and action needs tobe
performed
•Ahardware failure hasoccurred andneeds tobeaddressed16
Functions of an Operating System Cont. 
File Management
Filesystem isorganised indirectories foreasy navigation andefficient usage .
OScontrols filemanagement activities .
•Keeping track ofwhere thefiles arestored, useraccess settings, andthe
status offiles, etc.
•Keeping track ofinformation regarding thecreation, deletion, transfer,
copy, andstorage offilesinanorganised way.
•Maintaining theintegrity ofthedata stored inthefiles, including thefile
directory structure, byprotecting against unauthorised access .
17
Functions of an Operating System Cont. 
Storage Management
Thisrefers toallnon-volatile memory storage device management .
TheOSisincharge ofkeeping track offilesandprograms which arestored so
that they canbeaccessed quickly when they arerequested andtransferred
intomain memory .
Thisprocess …
•Improves theperformance ofthedata storage resource andoptimises the
useofstorage devices .
•Assists instoring more data onhardware devices .
•Speed upthedata retrieval process andprevents data losses .18
Functions of an Operating System Cont. 
Security Management 
Theoperating system provides various techniques toensure theintegrity and
confidentiality ofdata.
OS includes security -specific utility software like Firewalls, Anti -Malware, and 
Software Update checks.
That gives…
•Protection against unauthorised access.
•Protection against interruption by keeping the firewall active.
•Protecting the system memory against malicious access.
•Displaying messages related to system vulnerabilities.19
Functions of an Operating System Cont. 
User & Privilege Management 
Usually, OSprovides facilities tomanage thedifferent user accounts and
control their behaviours onvarious activities .
Because notallusers will getthesame opportunity towork with the
functionalities given bytheOS.
There aredifferent user account types like;Administrator, Backup Operator,
Power User, User, etc.
20
Functions of an Operating System Cont. 
Human Computer Interface (HCI)
People don’t know themethod ofcommunicating with thehardware/devices, so
OSgives theoption ofcommunicating with thecomputer with theinterfaces .
Itdefines allthemethods ofhowpeople interact with thecomputer system .Ifthe
interfaces aredifficult tointerpret itsmeaning, then users willfinditdifficult to
understand anduse.
HCIfocused oninterfaces between computers andpeople .
Earlier days, OSarebased onthecommand line, andmodern operating systems
arebased ongraphical nature .Meaning users willfeeleasytolearn andusetheOS
functionalities .
There isahighrelationship between HCIandUser Experience (UX).21

Let’s watch a small clip on this…
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e -YI-fjI8Nc
There are popular operating system brands and families such as Windows OS, Linux 
OS, Mac OS, VMS, OS/400, iOS, Android, etc.
But all of them have initially launched with basic features and matured with their 
age over the years.
Okey folks, time for a group activity. Find out more useful video resources on the 
evolution of various OS brands and let's discuss more on them.Q&A 
Time for your questions and queries ...
