Operating Systems Generations
First 
Generation
(1945 -1955)Vacuum Tubes
Plug Boards•Nodigital computers .Only used Calculating
Engines forcalculation purposes .
•Programming languages were unknown, and
programming wasdone inmachine language .
•In1950,punch cards were introduced, and
programs were written into thecards and
read intothesystem .
•This was the start ofBatch Processing
Systems .Jobs were collected together and
executed onejobatatime inasequence .
•Limited memory management capabilities,
Nomultitasking capabilities, andNoGUI.3
Operating Systems Generations Cont.
Second
Generation
(1955 -1965)Transistors
Batch Systems•Transistors were introduced andthat ledto
thedevelopment ofmore interactive and
responsive computer systems like
Mainframe .
•Multiprogramming and Multiprocessing
concepts were onthe rise.Real-time
systems have emerged inthisgeneration .
•Allowed multiple users toshare the
computer system .
•Magnetic tapes were used toread input to
batch processing systems .Output was
written intoanother tape.4
Operating Systems Generations Cont.
Third 
Generation
(1965 -1980)Integrated 
Circuits
Multiprogramming•Integrated Circuits introduced major
changes intheperformance andprice of
computer systems .
•Operating Systems are also built with
multiprogramming capability .
•Computers have become more user-
friendly with theInvention ofGUI and
Mouse .
•Newadditions toOSin3rdgeneration are…
✓Multitasking Capability
✓Networking Features
✓FileSystems5
Operating Systems Generations Cont.
Fourth 
Generation
(1980 -Present)Personal 
Computers•Large -scale integrated circuits were used to 
make Personal Computers. That led to the 
advancement of networks.
•Network Operating Systems and Distributed 
Operating Systems were created.
•Multitasking capabilities were increased.
