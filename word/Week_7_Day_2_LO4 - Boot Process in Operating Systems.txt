What is Boot Process?

Booting istheprocess ofstarting orresetting thecomputer when theuser
turns thesystem on.Theprocess includes getting both thehardware and
software ready andrunning .
Thebooting process isoftwotypes .
1.Cold Booting
Thisprocess happens when acomputer starts upforthefirsttime orwhen it
isshutdown, and thepower button ispressed tostart thesystem .The
operating system isautomatically loaded intothesystem during coldbooting
inthecomputer when themachine reads alltheBIOS (ROM) instructions .
Compared tohotorwarm booting, coldbooting takes longer .What is Boot Process? Cont.

2.Warm Booting
Warm booting isthetechnique ofrestarting analready onsystem without
completely turning itoff.Inthisprocess, theuserrestarts thesystem viathe
operating system .
Computer systems canrestart when they hang orreach astate ofnoresponse .
Analternative term foritisrebooting .
Thesystem must berestarted toapply software orhardware configuration
changes, after installing new software orhardware .Otherwise, itmay
perform incorrectly orrespond incorrectly .Steps of Booting Process
5
Step 1:BIOS isLoaded
Thefirst step involves turning onthepower .Itpowers theessential parts,
including theprocessor andBIOS, with electricity .
Step 2:BIOS :Power onSelf-Test
ThisisthefirsttestrunbytheBIOS.Additionally, thistestrunsapreliminary
examination ofthecomputer's main memory, disk drives, input/output
devices, etc.Moreover, thesystem emits abeep sound incase ofanyerrors .Steps of Booting Process Cont.

Step 3:Loading ofOS
The bootable sequence stored inthe CMOS (Common Metal Oxide
Semiconductor) isread byBIOS following thesuccessful completion ofPOST.
Based onthebootable sequence, itwilllookfortheMaster Boot Record (MBR)
onbootable devices such asUSB, CD-ROM, andhard disk.
Amessage saying "NoBoot Device Found" willbedisplayed, andthesystem
willcrash ifMBRisnotfound inanyofthem .IfMBR isdiscovered, theBIOS
willlaunch aunique application software called theBootloader ,which will
ultimately launch theoperating system .Steps of Booting Process Cont.
7
Step 4:System Configuration
Device drivers areputintothememory after theOSisloaded toensure the
proper operation ofalldevices .
Step 5:Loading System Utilities
Inthisstep, system utilities likeantivirus andvolume control areloaded into
thememory .Steps of Booting Process Cont.
8
Step 6:User Authentication
The system will prompt theuser toinput their credentials ifanyuser
authentication isconfigured .Once thesystem hasreceived valid credentials,
itwilltypically launch theGUIShell ortheCLIShell.Why do we Need Booting?
9
Thebooting prevents leaks ofmemory inthesystem .
Itchecks forupdates andinstalls them .
RAMisflushed during theprocess .
Makes small corrections toerrors intheprogram .Linux Boot Process
10
Theprocess flow starts with theBIOS, which searches foractive andbootable
devices .Thesystem boots Linux from thehard disk, inwhich theMBRcontains
theprimary bootloader .
TheLinux Boot Process consists ofthree stages .
1.TheBIOS Stage
2.TheBootloader Stage
3.Kernel StageLinux Boot Process Cont.
11
TheBIOS Stage
Thisisthefirststage oftheLinux boot process .
Itinitialises thesystem hardware during thebooting process .
TheBIOS retrieves theinformation, stored intheCMOS chip (Complementary
Metal -Oxide Semiconductor) which isabattery -operated memory chip onthe
motherboard that contains information about thesystem’s hardware
configuration .
BIOS performs aPower -OnSelf-Test(POST) tomake surethatallthehardware
components ofthesystem areworking .Linux Boot Process Cont.
12
TheBIOS Stage Cont .
Once BIOS confirms thateverything isfine, itstarts searching forthedrive or
diskwhich contains theoperating system inastandard sequence .
Ifthefirstlisted device isnotavailable ornotworking, then itchecks forthe
next oneandsoon.
Adrive canbebootable onlyifithastheMaster Boot Record initsfirstsector
known astheboot sector .Thesystem’s hard diskactsastheprimary boot disk
and theoptical drive works asthesecondary boot disk forbooting the
operating system from theremovable diskifincase themain hard diskfails.Linux Boot Process Cont.
13
TheBootloader Stage
The bootloader stage includes thetask ofloading theLinux kernel and
optional initial RAMdisk .Thekernel willhelp enable theCPUtoaccess RAM
andthedisk.
Thesecond precursor software isanimage ofatemporary virtual filesystem
called theinitrd image orinitial RAMdisk .Now, thesystem prepares todeploy
theactual root filesystem .Itthen detects thedevice that contains thefile
system andloads thenecessary modules .
Thelaststepofthebootloader stage istoloadthekernel intothememory .Linux Boot Process Cont.
14
Kernel Stage
Once thecontrol shifts from thebootloader stage totheKernel stage, the
virtual root filesystem created bytheinitrd image executes theLinuxrc
program .Thisprogram generates therealfilesystem forthekernel andlater
removes theinitrd image .
Thekernel then searches fornew hardware andloads anysuitable device
drivers found .
Itthen mounts theactual rootfilesystem andthen performs theinitprocess .
Theinitreads thefile“/etc/inittab ”anduses thisfiletoload therestofthe
system daemons .Thisprepares thesystem, andtheuser canloginandstart
using it.Linux Boot Process Cont.
15
Kernel Stage Cont .
Thetypical bootloaders forLinux areLILO (Linux Loader) andGRUB (Grand
Unified Bootloader) .These bootloaders allow theuser toselect which OS
kernel toloadduring boot time.Dual Booting
16
Dual booting ofanoperating system istheinstallation oftwo operating
systems onasingle computer .
Numerous operating systems canbeinstalled onsuch amachine .Tochoose
which operating system toboot, abootloader familiar with various file
systems andoperating systems canoccupy theboot space .
Once ithasbeen loaded, oneoftheoperating systems onthediskcanbe
booted .Onthedisk, there maybeseveral partitions, each ofwhich houses a
different operating system .
When acomputer system boots intotheoperating system, aboot manager
program displays amenu sotheusercanchoose theoperating system touse.Q&A
