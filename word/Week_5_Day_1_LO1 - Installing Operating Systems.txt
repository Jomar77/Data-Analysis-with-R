Preparation to Install 
3
Before selecting theoperating system toinstall following decisions must be
taken…
Upgrade oraFresh Installation
Physical Computer orVirtual Machine (VM)
Client orServer(Computer’s Role)
FewComputers orHundreds ofComputers
Environment Eg:Network EnvironmentSelecting an OS
4
Considering theextensive range ofOSavailable inthemarket, itisessential
tounderstand theunique needs ofthedevice .
Doing this enhances theworking experience onacomputer and boosts
productivity .
Asound operating system willalways impact everything running onadevice .
Without theright OS,hardware isofnovalue, nomatter howadvanced itis.
So,choose theOSasperuserrequirements .Selecting an OS
5
Check forHardware Configuration orSetup oftheComputer
•CPUArchitecture andSpeed
•RAMSpeed
•Free DiskSpace
•Network Connection
•Etc.
Existing computer hardware should becompatible with the minimum
requirements fortheoperating system .Otherwise, thehardware should be
upgraded tomatch theOSrequirements .
Alsoensure theexisting software operating correctly .Selecting an OS
6
Consider theBasic Design oftheComputer
Eg:HP ,IBM,oranApple Computer
Operating system should becompatible with thetype ofcomputer .
Alsolookfortheapplications intended toinstall onthecomputer .Selecting an OS Cont.
7
OSshould have thePower toManage theMemory
Memory management isanimportant consideration when selecting an
operating system .
Apowerful operating system iscapable ofhandling andmanaging integral
memory .Itkeeps track ofevery memory location, regardless ofwhether itis
assigned toaprocess orisfree.Asaresult, thedata imported from secondary
memory tomain memory isaccurate, available, andconsistent .There are
various operating systems onthemarket today notorious formemory hogs.So,
hunt forsoftware thathandles memory flawlessly .Selecting an OS Cont.
8
Robust &Stable OS
Thisisoneofthemost crucial factors when buying anOS.
Ifthecomputer often uses toaccess theInternet, forbusiness purposes, or
playgames, itrequires anOSthatisreliable anddependable .
OSshould efficiently handle allitsfunctions without crashing .
With anunstable operating system, thesystem willrequire toberebooted
constantly .Selecting an OS Cont.
9
Choose OSthat meets allBoard Support Package (BSP) Requirements
Operating systems aresoftware thatperforms allthebasic tasks, including all
fundamental functions, managing files, memory, processes, input andoutput,
andperipheral devices likeprinters anddiscdrives .
BSPissomething thatmade itallpossible .
Iftheselected OSdoes notsupport BSP ,it’snotworth buying one.Selecting an OS Cont.
10
Avoid Memory Leak
Amemory leak isabugthat canimpair theoverall functionality ofan
operating system andaspecific program onacomputer .
Intheworst -case scenario, thecomputer’s operating system crashes dueto
thevastdata storage .
Toavoid such athing, users should lookforanoperating system thatisfreeof
allmemory leaks .This willenhance theoverall working experience ona
computer .Selecting an OS Cont.
11
Good Memory -Sharing Capabilities
Good memory -sharing capabilities make transferring data easier between
various computer processes through modules andscripts .
Also, thisprocess makes communication faster andeasier than anyother
message -sending module .
Iftheselected operating system lacks good memory sharing, itcandelay other
processes andgiverisetovarious problems forusers andcomputers .Selecting an OS Cont.
12
Check allSafety Requirements
Thisisthething thatsaves thecomputer anddata from threats likehacking,
fraud, andscamming .
Linux andMacoperating systems arethought tobethesafest forbusiness,
online banking, andstoring sensitive data.Those reduce thepossibility of
hacking, duplicity, andfraud .
Windows hasfewer security safeguards, which increases thelikelihood that
hackers willsucceed inbreaking intothemachine .Selecting an OS Cont.
13
Security
Alloperating systems aresusceptible toviruses, butasWindows hasa
significant market share, itistargeted bythemost viruses .
Incontrast, Linux -based operating systems likeUbuntu orDebian aretheleast
receptive .
Macs arealsovulnerable toransomware explicitly created forMacs.Selecting an OS Cont.
14
Cost &Support
There isacommon belief thatthemore youpayforanOS,thebetter support
andexperience youwillget.
Thisisnotalways correct assometimes users cangetthebest experience at
thelowest price .That toowith reliable, lightweight, andvery good memory
management .
Look fortheUpdated Version OS
Even iftheoperating system isunfamiliar, itisbetter tolookfortherecently
updated operating system .Types of Installations
15
Clean Install
Acompletely new installation ofanoperating system orapplication ona
computer .
Inaclean install ofanOS,thehard diskisformatted andcompletely erased .
Installing anOSonanew computer orinstalling anapplication forthefirst
time isautomatically aclean install .
Insome cases, aclean install isnotnecessary when upgrading your operating
system .Itismuch easier andsafer toperform astandard “Upgrade and
Install,” which simply upgrades thenecessary filesandleaves theuserfilesin
place .Types of Installations Cont.
16
Clean Install Cont .
However, sometimes anOSupgrade isnotpossible because important files
have become lostorcorrupted .Inthiscase, aclean install maybetheonly
option .
Some users may alsoprefer toperform aclean install sothat nolingering
problems from theprevious OSwillaffect thenewly installed operating
system .
Windows, MacOSX,andLinux allow youtoperform aclean install when
upgrading theoperating system .
Theinstaller willgiveyouthechoice between astandard upgrade (typically
thedefault option) and aclean installation near thebeginning ofthe
installation process .Types of Installations Cont.
17
Repair Install
Iftheinstalled OSisacting upormisbehaving, itispossible toperform a
reinstallation ofthesame OSthat keeps allfiles, documents, data, settings,
andapps intact .
Reinstalling does notformat your PCandcanbeused tocorrect problems with
missing DLLerrors, failed System FileChecker (SFC) scans, theStart Menu
doesn’t work, andmore .Types of Installations Cont.
18
In-Place Upgrade
The installation ofanoperating system orapplication onthecomputer
without removing theolder version firstandwithout saving anydata beyond
normal precautions .
In-place installations ofoperating systems have atendency tocause problems,
especially ifthenewversion isverydifferent from theprevious one.
Forexample, in-place upgrades arerecommended when migrating from
Windows Vista toWindows 7,butnotfrom Windows XP.Inthatcase, a“Clean
Install” isrecommended, whereby alluserdata must besaved externally and
restored after theinstallation, andallapplications must bere-installed .Types of Installations Cont.
19
Unattended Installations
AnUnattended Installation isanautomated installation technology that you
canusetoinstall with nouserintervention .
Unattended installation istypically used during large -scale rollouts when it
would betoo slow and costly tohave administrators ortechnicians
interactively install theOperating System /Software onindividual computers .Types of Installations Cont.
20
Multi -boot
Dual-boot isaterm used todescribe acomputer that utilises twooperating
systems .
Forexample, with adual-boot youcould have Windows 10andLinux onthe
same machine .Theconcept ofinstalling more than twooperating systems is
referred toasamulti -boot.
The interest indual-booting exists because thereisn’t aone-size-fits-all
solution tooperating systems .While anymodern OSwillcover theaverage
person’s day-to-daycomputer needs, forthose who need tousespecialised
programs orwant totrymore experimental operating systems without
sacrificing their computer usability, dual-booting offers aflexible solution .Types of Installations Cont.
21
Remote /Network Installation
Remote /Network Installation isaneasy-to-usenetwork application designed
forcentralised software management andaudit across aNetwork .
Theprogram allows youtoaudit software installed onremote PCsacross your
network anddeploy software automatically onremote PCs.
Theprogram deploys software inparallel onremote PCs, sousers candeploy
within afewminutes across theentire network .Device Drivers
22
Adevice driver isacomputer program that operates orcontrols aparticular
type ofdevice thatisattached toacomputer .
Adriver provides asoftware interface tohardware devices, enabling operating
systems andother computer programs toaccess hardware functions without
needing toknow precise details about thehardware being used.
Device drivers areessential foracomputer system towork properly because,
without adevice driver, theparticular hardware fails towork accordingly,
which means itfailsindoing thefunction/action itwascreated todo.Device Drivers Cont.
23
Device Drivers Cont.
24
Hardware devices thatareunknown bytheoperating system orhave features
unknown bytheoperating system allrequire drivers .
Eg:Card Reader, Controller, Modem, Motherboard Chipset, Network Card,
Printer, Scanner, Sound Card, Tape Drive, USBDevices, Video Card, etc.
Modern operating systems have many generic drivers that allow hardware to
work atabasic level without needing drivers orsoftware .Butifthat device
hasfeatures unknown totheoperating system, itwillnotwork without
drivers .
Eg:CPU, DiscDrive, Fan, Hard Drive, Heat Sink, Joystick, Keyboard, Mouse,
Monitor, Power Supply, RAM, Speakers, UPS, etc.Types of Device Drivers
25
Kernel -Mode Device Drivers
ThisKernel -Mode device driver includes some generic hardware that loads with
theoperating system aspart oftheOSthese areBIOS, motherboard, processor,
andsome other hardware that arepart ofkernel software .These include the
minimum system requirement device drivers foreach operating system .
User -Mode Device Drivers
Other than thedevices which arebrought bythekernel forworking thesystem
theuseralsobrings some devices foruseduring theuseofasystem thatdevices
need device drivers tofunction those drivers fallunder theUser-Mode device
driver .Forexample, theuser needs anyplug-and-play action that comes under
this.Virtual Device Drivers
26
There arealso Virtual Device Drivers (VxD), which manage thevirtual
machine/device .
Sometimes weusethesame hardware virtually atthat time virtual driver
controls/manages thedata flow from thedifferent applications used by
different users tothesame hardware .
InMicrosoft Windows, adevice driver iscontrolled bytheOperating System’s
Virtual Device Driver Manager (VDDM) and isshared bytheapplications
running within thatkernel .Q&A
