Introduction
3
Modern computer systems arechanging rapidly .
Computer system users expect theoperating system tomanage system
resources andprovide useful services with minimal overhead .
Inreality, modern operating systems arelarge andmore complex programs
with memory andCPUrequirements than many other application programs .
So,itisimportant toconsider thefunctionality andfeatures ofthemain
components ofthecomputer system architecture .Computer System Architecture
4
Thisrefers tothestructure oftheinternal components ofacomputer system .
Itshows thecomponents thatmake upacomputer system anddescribes how
they areinterconnected, interact with each other, and how they are
managed .
Modern computers often follow the Von Neumann Architecture ,which
includes ...
•Aprocessor
•Amemory unit-which stores both instructions anddata
•Connections forI/Odevices
•Secondary storage fordataComputer System Architecture Cont.

VonNeumann Architecture
John VonNeumann developed thestored program concept inthe1940s.TheVon
Neumann architecture used theidea ofstoring program instructions anddata in
themain memory andmoving them between memory andtheprocessor .
Central Processing Unit
6
CPUisthemost crucial logic circuit (integrated circuit) thatresponds toand
processes thebasic instructions thatdrive acomputer .
CPU interprets most computer commands, performs most arithmetic, logic,
andI/Ooperations, andallocates commands forother chips andcomponents
running inacomputer .
Processors canbefound inPCs,smartphones, tablets, andother computers .
Core isonaCPU’s processor .Earlier every processor hadjustonecore that
could focus ononetaskatatime.
Most ofthemodern processors aremulti -core.That means CPUs have twoor
more cores, each ofwhich canwork ondifferent tasks.Central Processing Unit Cont.
7
Multi core concept enhances performance, reduce power consumption and
processing become more efficient due tothesimultaneous processing of
multiple tasks.
Ina"single core" CPU, theprocessor chip hasonecore.Andadual-core
processor hastwocores, aquad-core hasfour, ahexa-core hassix,anocta-
core haseight, andsoon.
Some processors usemulti -threading, which uses virtualised processor cores .
Virtualised processor cores arecalled vCPUs .These arenotaspowerful as
physical cores butcanbeused toimprove performance inVirtual Machines
(VMs) .However, adding unnecessary vCPUs canhurt consolidation ratios, so
there should beabout fourtosixvCPUs perphysical core.Components of the CPU
8
Arithmetic &Logical Unit (ALU)
The ALU isresponsible forperforming arithmetic calculations andlogical
operations such as…
•Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
•Logical bitwise operations, such asAND, OR,NOT , andXOR
•Comparisons between values, such asgreater than, lessthan, equal to
•Shifting binary patterns totheleftorrightComponents of the CPU Cont.
9
Control Unit (CU)
Thecontrol unit organises theexecution ofinstructions andmanages the
other components intheprocessor .Itisresponsible for…
•Ensuring theexecution ofinstructions inthecorrect sequence
•Decoding every instruction thattheprocessor willexecute
•Sending andreceiving control signals toandfrom other components
•Checking thatsignals have been delivered successfully
•Making surethatdata goes tothecorrect place atthecorrect time
Thecontrol unitalsocontains theclock .Thisisatinycomponent thatcontrols
therateatwhich instructions areexecuted intheprocessor .Components of the CPU Cont.
10
Clock
The clock signal isused tosynchronise theoperations oftheprocessor
components .Thesystem clock generates regular clock pulses byemitting a
signal that continuously switches between alow(or'0')andahigh (or'1')
state .
Thetime taken between twosequential rising edges iscalled aclock cycle or
aclock period .Theclock speed ismeasured bythenumber ofclock cycles in
onesecond .
Components of the CPU Cont.
11
Clock Cont .
Every operation oftheprocessor requires anumber ofclock cycles to
complete .Thenumber ofcycles isspecific toeach type ofprocessor .
1clock cycle persecond is1Hz.
When theclock speed isincreased, theexecution time forinstructions
decreases .Therefore, more cycles persecond increase theperformance .
Butthere isalimit onclock speed .Iftheheat generated byhigher clock
speeds cannot beremoved fastenough, thatcanbeledtooverheating .1 million Hz (106Hz) 1 megahertz
1000 MHz (109Hz) 1 gigahertzComponents of the CPU Cont.
12
Registers
Registers arelocations ofcomputer memory within theprocessor thatprovide
extremely fastaccess .There aretwotypes ofregisters .
General -purpose Registers -Accessing themain memory canslow down the
execution ofinstructions .Therefore, theprocessor uses general -purpose
registers totemporarily store theresults oftheintermediate calculations that
arepartoflarger computations .
Dedicated orSpecial -purpose Registers -Used foraspecific purpose .
Involves inthefetch -decode -execute cycle .Each oneofthem hasaspecific
roletoplayineach phase .Components of the CPU Cont.
13
Dedicated orSpecial -purpose Registers Cont .
Program Counter (PC) -Holds theaddress ofthenext instruction tobe
executed bytheprocessor .
Current Instruction Register (CIR) -Holds thecurrent instruction that the
processor isexecuting .
Memory Address Register (MAR) -Temporarily stores thememory addresses
used when searching fordata inRAM
Memory Data Register (MDR) /Memory Buffer Register (MBR) -Temporarily
holds thedata (data values orinstructions) that areread from orwritten to
themain memory
Accumulator -Stores theresult ofanycalculationComponents of the CPU Cont.
14
Buses
Abustransfers data andsignals between components inside thecomputer .
There arethree types ofbuses .
•Address Bus-Carries address locations ofstored data from theprocessor
tomemory andinput/output devices .
•Data Bus–Sends thedata toandfrom theprocessor, memory, andinput
andoutput devices .
•Control Bus -Carries signals that coordinate theoperation ofthe
components .
Theaddress ,data,andcontrol bustogether isknown asthesystem bus.Components of the CPU Cont.
15
Cache Memory
Cache Memory isahigh-speed memory, which issmall insizebutfaster than
themain memory (RAM) .
TheCPUcanaccess itmore quickly than theprimary memory .So,itisused to
synchronise with high-speed CPUandtoimprove itsperformance .
Components of the CPU Cont.
16
Cache Memory Cont .
There aremany levels ofcache memory …
L1Cache –This isacache memory that isdirectly built into the
microprocessor, which isused forstoring recently accessed information .Itis
alsocalled theprimary cache .Each andevery core oftheCPUhasitsownL1
cache memory .
L2Cache –Thismemory isbuilt intotheCPUchip oroutside theCPUonthe
motherboard .TheL2cache feeds theL1cache, which feeds theprocessor .L2
cache memory isslower than L1cache memory .Components of the CPU Cont.
17
Cache Memory Cont .
L3Cache –This isaspecialised memory developed toimprove the
performance ofL1andL2.L1andL2isfaster than L3,butL3isusually faster
than theRAM.With multicore processors, each core canhave adedicated L1
andL2cache, butthey canshare anL3cache .
L4Cache –Thisisanextra layer ofcache located outside theprocessor cores
butinside theCPUpackage .Thiscache isnotpresent inalltheprocessors .
Some high-endprocessors mayhave thistype ofcache .Fetch -Decode -Execute Cycle
18
Thisdescribes thebasic operation ofthecentral processing unit.
Fetch -Decode -Execute Cycle Cont.
19
Fetch
Fetch involves retrieving aninstruction from themain memory .
Theinstruction's location (address) inmain memory isdetermined bythe
program counter, which stores anumber that identifies theaddress ofthe
next instruction tobefetched .
After aninstruction isfetched, thePCisincremented bythelength ofthe
instruction sothat itwillcontain theaddress ofthenext instruction inthe
sequence .
https ://www .youtube .com/watch?v=m 6vkJV4UeI4&t=100sFetch -Decode -Execute Cycle Cont.
20
Decode
Once aninstruction isfetched andstored intheCIR, theCPU passes the
instruction toacircuit called theinstruction decoder .
Thisconverts theinstruction intosignals tobepassed through toother parts
oftheCPUforaction .

Processors, andRISC-V.Types of CPU Cont.
23
Features ofRISC (Reduced Instruction SetComputer)
One cycle execution time -Forexecuting each instruction inacomputer, the
RISCprocessors require oneCPI(Cycles perInstruction) .Andeach CPIincludes
thefetch, decode andexecute method applied incomputer instruction .
Pipelining technique -Thepipelining technique isused intheRISC processors
toexecute multiple parts orstages ofinstructions toperform more efficiently .

CISC (Complex Instruction SetComputer)
TheCISC wasdeveloped byIntel.CISC processors areused indesktop and
laptop computers .Ithasalarge collection ofcomplex instructions thatrange
from simple tovery complex andspecialised intheassembly language level,
which takes alongtime toexecute theinstructions .
CISC approaches reducing thenumber ofinstructions oneach program and
ignoring thenumber ofcycles perinstruction .
Itemphasises building complex instructions directly inthehardware because
thehardware isalways faster than thesoftware .ButCISC chips arerelatively
slower ascompared toRISCchips butuselittle instruction than CISC.
Examples ofCISCprocessors areVAX,AMD, Intel x86,andtheSystem/ 360.Types of CPU Cont.
