Saving time andresources byavoiding theneed tocreate anddistribute
physical media orcopy filestolocal drives .
Simplify the management and maintenance ofsoftware updates and
configurations bycentralising them onthenetwork server .
Reduce theriskofdata lossorcorruption byminimising theuseofremovable
orunreliable media orstorage devices .
Support different types ofhardware andsoftware byallowing customisation
andflexibility oftheinstallation process .Disadvantages of Network Installation

Availability andperformance ofthenetwork andserver canaffect thespeed
andreliability oftheinstallation process .
Additional configuration andtroubleshooting ofthenetwork andtheboot
agent mayberequired, which canbecomplex andtime-consuming .
Security andprivacy risks canbeposed byexposing theinstallation files and
settings tothenetwork, asthey canbeintercepted ortampered with by
